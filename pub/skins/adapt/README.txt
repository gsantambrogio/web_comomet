This skin was originally built May 2014, starting with source from:

 http://purecss.io/layouts/side-menu/

The hard part was done by the YUI and Normalise.js developers.

This skin's page on PmWiki.org:

This skin and the CMS Mode recipe combine to make a powerful,
fully-operational mobile-responsive PmWiki-powered CMS that
can be up and running in minutes.

Enjoy.
